                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    	        
    	        <p>Taskalito is designed with simplicity in mind. Its purpose is to enable the fast creation of descriptive tasks via your images.</p>

    			<p>The chief way for creating tasks is by pressing the big plus button at the bottom of the home screen. In addition you can swipe leftwards from the right edge of the home view. Doing either one will pop a panel with a list of options. These options are namely three - Camera, Photo library and Template.</p>

    			<p>Choosing Camera and Photo library will redirect you to the Task Form. In the Task Form, you can set an image. Optionally you can also set a timer and a title for your task.</p> 

    			<p>If you choose the Template option you will redirected to a list of previously saved task templates. To create a new task from a template just tap on the template item.</p> 

    			<p>Once a task is created, it appears at the Tasks View. Existing tasks can be modified by tapping on them. They can be also deleted or saved as templates directly from the Tasks View by tapping on the task and choosing one of the buttons that have showed up.</p>

                <h2>Notifications</h2>
                  
               	<p>Tasks can optionally have timers set on them. By toggling the time picker in the Task Form Ð° timer is created and a notification is scheduled automatically when the form is saved. When the timer is over, a notification is triggered along with a sound and a message.</p> 

    			<p>Notifications may appear both when the app is active and closed. When the app is active, a notification panel is displayed with a few options for snoozing, deleting (dismissing) and ignoring (canceling) it.</p> 

    			<p>If the app is closed (inactive), a standard local/push notification appears. Since the application is designed for iOS8, these notification messages are interactive. When a message appears, just pan downwards on it and you can snooze by the default time or dismiss the task.</p>

                <h2>Templates</h2>
                
                <p>One of the great features of Taskalito is the ability to save and reuse tasks. </p>

                <p>Saving a task as a template is simple. You need to tap on a task item and then select the Save icon.</p>

                <p>Templates appear in the Templates View. The templates view can be called from the settings menu or as the third option when creating a new task by swiping left from the right edge of the main view as explained in Getting Started. </p>

                <p>Individual templates can be deleted by swiping left on a template item in the Templates View. </p>

                <p>A template can modified by pressing Edit. This will display the standard task form which has a delete button at the bottom. </p>

                <h2>Customization</h2>

                <p>Taskalito provides a few options to make it your own.</p>

    			<p>One way is to change the layout of the Tasks View. It can be arranged as a grid or a list. Toggling between the two layouts requires a tap on the Icon on toolbar in the the top right.</p>

    			<p>Other customisation options are provided in the Settings View. The menu can be opened by tapping the Menu Icon at the top left or by swiping rightwards from the left edge of the Tasks View.  There are two themes to choose from - Light and Dark. You can choose the notification sound and the default snooze time for push notifications.</p>
